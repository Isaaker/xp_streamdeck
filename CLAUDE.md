# xp_streamdeck — Stream Deck Plugin for X-Plane 12 on macOS

## Goal

A native macOS Stream Deck plugin (Elgato Stream Deck XL) that controls X-Plane 12 via its native Web API — generic enough to drive any DataRef or CommandRef from a button, including state-based images (e.g. Gear UP/DOWN). Replaces the keyboard-shortcut workaround on Mac, where the Windows-only PilotsDeck has no equivalent.

## Tech Stack

- **Language:** TypeScript (strict mode)
- **Runtime:** Node.js 24+ (required by `@elgato/streamdeck`)
- **SDK:** `@elgato/streamdeck` (official npm package, bundled by Elgato CLI scaffold)
- **Bundler:** Rollup (preconfigured by `streamdeck create`)
- **HTTP client:** native `fetch` (Node 24)
- **WebSocket client:** `ws`
- **Property Inspector:** HTML + vanilla JS, optionally `@elgato/sdpi-components`
- **Target:** macOS only (private/sideloaded — no notarization)

## Talking to X-Plane

X-Plane 12.1.1+ exposes a native Web API on `localhost:8086` — both REST and WebSocket. **No custom XPLM C++ plugin required.**

- REST base: `http://localhost:8086/api/v3`
- WebSocket: `ws://localhost:8086/api/v3`
- Capabilities used: read/write DataRefs, activate Commands, subscribe to DataRef changes (~10 Hz)
- Docs: <https://developer.x-plane.com/article/x-plane-web-api/>

### Important runtime details

- DataRef and Command **numeric IDs are session-scoped** — re-resolve on every X-Plane restart.
- Web API is localhost-only by design (fine for our case — Stream Deck and X-Plane on same Mac).
- The Web API was introduced in X-Plane 12.1.1 (Jan 2025). Pin `/api/v3` as a constant to make future version bumps easy.

## Working Style

- **Walking skeleton first, then layer up.** Always get a thin end-to-end slice working before adding breadth. M01 (one button → X-Plane Pause) is the foundation everything else depends on.
- **One milestone per session.** Each `.md` in `.claude/tasks/` is self-contained: scope, deliverables, acceptance criteria, verification steps. Don't pull from earlier session context — re-read the relevant milestone file.
- **English** in all code, comments, manifest strings, and milestone files. Communication with the user remains German.
- **Default to no comments.** Only add a comment when the *why* is non-obvious.
- **No premature abstractions.** Three similar lines beat a flexible factory.
- **Verification before claiming done.** Each milestone has explicit verification steps — run them before marking complete.
- **Pre-commit gate:** `make check` (Biome lint + `tsc --noEmit`). Must be green before any commit.

## Action Implementation Conventions (locked in during M03)

Patterns every new action under `src/actions/` should follow:

- **Settings type:** `type FooSettings = JsonObject & { /* keys */ }`. `JsonObject` is exported from `@elgato/utils` (NOT from `@elgato/streamdeck`) — it's required to satisfy the `SingletonAction<T extends JsonObject>` constraint.
- **Visual feedback on `keyDown`:** call `ev.action.showOk()` on success (optionally gated by an opt-out setting), `ev.action.showAlert()` on every failure path including empty/invalid config. Errors must always be visible — never gate `showAlert()` behind a setting.
- **sdpi-checkbox defaults are unreliable.** `default="true"` on `<sdpi-checkbox>` does not round-trip cleanly when the user unchecks (we hit this with `showConfirmation`). **Always design checkboxes so unchecked = baseline behavior, checked = opt-in to a deviation.** In code use `=== true` (not `!== false`) so a missing setting maps to the baseline.
- **Property Inspector** lives in `com.robertw.xplane.sdPlugin/ui/<action>.html` and loads sdpi-components v4 from CDN (`https://sdpi-components.dev/releases/v4/sdpi-components.js`).
- **No floating promises.** Biome's `noFloatingPromises` will fail the build. Wrap fire-and-forget async with `.catch((err) => streamDeck.logger.error(...))` or `await` it.
- **Read settings via `ev.payload.settings`** in `onKeyDown`/`onKeyUp`/`onWillAppear`. Trim string inputs.

## Button Icon Pipeline

To keep buttons visually consistent (one of M01's pain points was inconsistent purchased icon packs), button images are generated locally instead of curated by hand.

- **Entry:** `make icons` → `npm run icons` → `tsx scripts/generate-icons.ts`.
- **Output:** `out/icons/<group>/*.png` (144×144, gitignored, wiped by `make clean`). One subdirectory per group.
- **Three icon kinds, one catalog (discriminated union on `kind`):**
  - **`toggle`** — for buttons that flip a state. Produces `<name>_on.png` + `<name>_off.png`. Bold label + LED bar at bottom (lit/dark by state).
  - **`display`** — for the `dataref-display` action. Produces a single `<name>.png`. Caption + accent line in the top third; the lower ⅔ is intentionally empty so Stream Deck's `setTitle()` overlay (the live value) sits cleanly underneath.
  - **`nudge`** — single-press command button (heading bug ±, altitude bug ±, etc.). Produces a single `<name>.png`. Bold label at top, big filled triangle in the accent color in the lower portion (single triangle for normal step, two stacked for `double: true` coarse step).
- **Groups drive both color and output directory.** One accent per group, declared once in `GROUP_ACCENT` at the top of `scripts/icons/catalog.ts`:
  - `autopilot` → yellow (`#eab308`) — AP/FD mode toggles, AP setpoint readouts, AP nudges
  - `lights` → green (`#22c55e`) — BCN, LAND, TAXI, NAV, STROBE
  - `cockpit` → green (`#22c55e`) — PARK BRK, FUEL PUMP, MASTER BAT, AVIONICS, PITOT HEAT
  - `readouts` → white (`#ffffff`) — live values (HDG, ALT, IAS, BARO, WIND, …)
- **Adding an icon = one catalog row.** In `scripts/icons/catalog.ts`:
  ```ts
  { kind: 'toggle',  name: 'apu',     label: 'APU', group: 'cockpit' },
  { kind: 'display', name: 'cur_oat', label: 'OAT', group: 'readouts' },
  { kind: 'nudge',   name: 'crs_left', label: 'CRS', direction: 'left', group: 'autopilot' },
  ```
  No template change needed unless you want a new visual *kind*. To add a new color category, extend the `IconGroup` type + `GROUP_ACCENT` map.
- **Visual style is centralized** in `scripts/icons/template.ts` — three render functions (`renderToggleIcon`, `renderDisplayIcon`, `renderNudgeIcon`), all layout/color constants at the top of each block. The accent color is resolved via `GROUP_ACCENT[def.group]` — never per-icon. Change once, re-run `make icons`, every icon of that kind updates identically. **Do not** branch per-icon style inside a renderer; if a new visual shape is needed (e.g. two-line text), add a fourth `kind` to the union plus a fourth render function.
- **Label sizing.**
  - **Toggle:** ≤4 chars at 44px; longer labels auto-shrink in fixed steps (5→36, 6→30, 7→26, 8→22, 9→20, 10+→18) via `toggleFontSize()`. Labels of the same length always render at the same size — groups stay uniform within themselves.
  - **Display:** fixed 22px (designed for 6-character max — `AP HDG`, `W SPD`).
  - **Nudge:** fixed 36px label (≤4 chars expected — the arrow is the visual focus, not the label).
- **Renderer is reproducible only as far as system fonts go.** The SVG references `-apple-system, …, Helvetica Neue, Arial`. Rasterization on macOS picks one of those; on a Linux CI box without those fonts, output will differ. If cross-machine reproducibility becomes a requirement (OSS release etc.), embed an OFL/Apache font as base64 in the SVG.

## Test Environment Reality

- The **dev laptop has no Stream Deck connected.** Stream Deck app + plugin sideloading reach ~90% of testing surface; final hardware verification happens on the flight-sim Mac.
- X-Plane runs on the same Mac as Stream Deck — both default to localhost.
- Smoke-test the X-Plane Web API with `curl` first whenever debugging suspect plugin behavior:
  ```
  curl 'http://localhost:8086/api/v3/datarefs?filter[name]=sim/cockpit2/controls/gear_handle_down'
  ```
